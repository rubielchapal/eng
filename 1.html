<h1>2/25 Vocabulary you will need in this course</h1>


<p>

●	Clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb. Sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.For example: I ate pizza.

<br>●	Sentence: a set of words that is complete in itself, typically containing a subject and predicate, conveying a statement, question, exclamation, or command, and consisting of a main clause and sometimes one or more subordinate clauses.For example: I ate a dessert after dinner. 
<br>●	Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns. We often use them to avoid repeating the nouns that they refer to. For example: I, you, her, theirs

<br>●	A subject is a part of a sentence that contains the person or thing performing the action. For example: She, my friend, you

<br>●	An object is the person, place, or thing that receives the action. I love hotdogs. For example: me, them, us

<br>●	They are made up of a verb and a particle or, sometimes, two particles. The particle often changes the meaning of the verb. For example: fill in, look up to

<br>●	Placeholder names are words that can refer to things or people whose names do not exist, are temporarily forgotten, irrelevant, or unknown in the context in which they are being discussed. For example: bla bla bla, “name”<br><br>
