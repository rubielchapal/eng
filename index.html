- Talking about rules:

‘Should’ is not a rule.
We use ‘should’ to talk about something that would be beneficial or better to do.

“You shouldn’t lie”.

- Must / Mustn’t 

Must is a rule.
It is a rule that is possible to break.
“You must be quiet during class”.
“You mustn’t eat in class”.

Have to / Don’t have to

‘Have to’ is a rule but ‘don’t have to’ means that something is not necessary.
You have to be 21 to drink alcohol in the USA, but you don’t have to be 21 to drive!

- Need / Needn’t

‘Need’ can be used to explain a rule.
‘Needn’t’ means that something is not necessary.
“You need to finish high school before going to University”.
“You needn’t tell me… I already know!”

- Fun fact:

Americans don’t use ‘must’ and ‘mustn’t’.
They usually use ‘have to’ or ‘need to’ instead of using ‘must’.
They usually use ‘can’t’ instead of ‘mustn’t’.

<h4>17/26 Comparison and preferences</h4>

<div class="MaterialLecture"><div class="MaterialLecture-text"><p><strong>Lee el texto y presta atención al uso de <em>(not) (the) same as</em> y <em>like better/more than</em>:</strong></p>
<p>I have lived in two countries in South America: Brazil and Colombia. Every country has its particularities, but at the same time, they have more things in common than we imagine.</p>
<p>Living in Brazil <strong>is not the same as</strong> living in Colombia, but you can get used to it fast. People in Colombia are friendly. They can make you feel good in every environment. Also, there is great food there, but I still <strong>like</strong> Brazilian food <strong>better than</strong> Colombian. The flavors are not quite the same.</p>
<p>The economy is also similar in both countries, but Brazil is more expensive. You can earn the same working in both countries, but you end up spending more in Brazil. So, in this way, I <strong>like</strong> living in Colombia <strong>more than</strong> in Brazil.</p>
<p>Another aspect I can mention is the weather. Brazil is such a big country that you can find all kinds of weather. Some cities are hotter than others. Some others are really cold during winter. Colombia is <strong>not the same as</strong> Brazil in this aspect. You don’t feel the weather change very much there. If the city is hot, it is like that the entire year. The same happens if the city is cold.</p>
<p>It’s hard to choose one <strong>I like better than</strong> the other.</p>
</div></div>

<h5>Grocery shopping</h5>
<p><strong>Person 1:</strong> Rachel and the kids are coming for lunch today. We have to prepare something special.<br>
<strong>Person 2:</strong> Oh! I had forgotten about that. You’re right. What about cooking some seafood? It’s delicious.<br>
<strong>Person 1:</strong> Yeah! It’s delicious. But it’s not easy to prepare. How about making pasta? It’s easier to cook, and I like it more than seafood.<br>
<strong>Person 2:</strong> Ok, then. Pasta it is. Shall we go grocery shopping?<br>
<strong>Person 1:</strong> First, we need a shopping list… We need to buy a few things.<br>
<strong>Person 2:</strong> Right! We need to buy spaghetti, an onion, some garlic, a little salt, and pepper… (speaking fast)<br>
<strong>Person 1:</strong> Slow down! You are speaking too fast. (pretending to write)<br>
<strong>Person 2:</strong> Sorry!<br>
<strong>Person 1:</strong> (pretending to finish the list) salt and pepper… The tomato sauce! We should buy the canned one!<br>
<strong>Person 2:</strong> Of course not! Preparing a fresh tomato sauce is not the same as buying one. Fresh tomatoes make a more delicious sauce.<br>
<strong>Person 1:</strong> Ok! We can buy fresh tomatoes if you insist. But YOU cook the sauce! I don’t cook well enough…<br>
<strong>Person 2:</strong> No problem. Do you have a big pan? We need a big one. Three people are coming, plus us two…<br>
<strong>Person 1:</strong> Sure! Like the big one over there?<br>
<strong>Person 2:</strong> Nice! I’m getting hungry already (hahaha).<br>
<strong>Person 1:</strong> Me too! I believe we have everything we need on the list. And if not, we can add a few items to the list when we get to the grocery store. Shall we go now?<br>
