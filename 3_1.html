          <p>What is the difference between “most of” and “some of”?
            <br> <br>          
            Both terms are use to quantify of a specific group.
            <br> <br>
            “Most of” refers to majority of a group. More than a half.
            <br>
            Example: Most of us at Platzi like challenges. 💪
            <br> <br>          
            “Some of” refers to a small percentage of a group. About twenty five percent.
            <br>
            Example: Only some of my friends want to study English. 😕

          <p>
          - Needs<br><br>
          
          A need is something that is essential to life.<br>
          Our basic human needs are to eat, drink, sleep, etc.<br><br>
          
          - How we use the word “Need”<br><br>
          
          We use it to talk about important things. It is also a way of asking someone to help you:<br>
          “I really need to get a good night’s sleep tonight”.<br>
          “I need you to call the client and tell him...”<br><br>
          
          Negative form<br><br>
          
          Don’t need<br>
          “I don’t need your help right now”.<br>
          “You didn’t need to do that!”<br>
          
          Question form:<br><br>
          
          Do you / what / need...?<br>
          “Does he need help?”<br>

          <h2>24/28  Expectations</h2><hr>
          <p>
          - Talking about rules:<br><br>
          
          ● Should / shouldn’t<br>
          ● Must / mustn’t<br>
          ● Have to / don’t have to<br>
          ● Need / needn’t<br><br>
          
          - Should / shouldn’t<br>
          ‘Should’ is not a rule.<br>
          We use ‘should’ to talk about something that would be beneficial or better to do.<br>
          “You should brush your teeth 3 times a day”.<br>
          “You shouldn’t lie”.<br><br>
          
          - Must / Mustn’t <br><br>
          
          Must is a rule.<br>
          It is a rule that is possible to break.<br>
          “You must be quiet during class”.<br>
          “You mustn’t eat in class”.<br><br>
          
          Have to / Don’t have to<br>
          
          ‘Have to’ is a rule but ‘don’t have to’ means that something is not necessary.<br>
          You have to be 21 to drink alcohol in the USA, but you don’t have to be 21 to drive!<br><br>
          
          - Need / Needn’t<br><br>
          
          ‘Need’ can be used to explain a rule.<br>
          ‘Needn’t’ means that something is not necessary.<br>
          “You need to finish high school before going to University”.<br>
          “You needn’t tell me… I already know!”<br><br>
