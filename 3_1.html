          ‚ÄòShould‚Äô is not a rule.<br>
          We use ‚Äòshould‚Äô to talk about something that would be beneficial or better to do.<br>
          ‚ÄúYou should brush your teeth 3 times a day‚Äù.<br>
          ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt lie‚Äù.<br><br>
          
          - Must / Mustn‚Äôt <br><br>
          
          Must is a rule.<br>
          It is a rule that is possible to break.<br>
          ‚ÄúYou must be quiet during class‚Äù.<br>
          ‚ÄúYou mustn‚Äôt eat in class‚Äù.<br><br>
          
          Have to / Don‚Äôt have to<br>
          
          ‚ÄòHave to‚Äô is a rule but ‚Äòdon‚Äôt have to‚Äô means that something is not necessary.<br>
          You have to be 21 to drink alcohol in the USA, but you don‚Äôt have to be 21 to drive!<br><br>
          
          - Need / Needn‚Äôt<br><br>
          
          ‚ÄòNeed‚Äô can be used to explain a rule.<br>
          ‚ÄòNeedn‚Äôt‚Äô means that something is not necessary.<br>
          ‚ÄúYou need to finish high school before going to University‚Äù.<br>
          ‚ÄúYou needn‚Äôt tell me‚Ä¶ I already know!‚Äù<br><br>
          
          - Fun fact:<br><br>
          
          Americans don‚Äôt use ‚Äòmust‚Äô and ‚Äòmustn‚Äôt‚Äô.<br>
          They usually use ‚Äòhave to‚Äô or ‚Äòneed to‚Äô instead of using ‚Äòmust‚Äô.<br>
          They usually use ‚Äòcan‚Äôt‚Äô instead of ‚Äòmustn‚Äôt‚Äô.<br><br>
