          “Most of” refers to majority of a group. More than a half.
          Example: Most of us at Platzi like challenges. 💪

          A need is something that is essential to life.
          Our basic human needs are to eat, drink, sleep, etc.
          
          - How we use the word “Need”
          
          We use it to talk about important things. It is also a way of asking someone to help you:
          “I really need to get a good night’s sleep tonight”.
          “I need you to call the client and tell him...”
          
          Negative form
          
          Don’t need
          “I don’t need your help right now”.
          “You didn’t need to do that!”

          <h2>24/28  Expectations</h2><hr>
          <pre>
          - Talking about rules:
          
          ● Should / shouldn’t
          ● Must / mustn’t
          ● Have to / don’t have to
          ● Need / needn’t
          
          - Should / shouldn’t
          ‘Should’ is not a rule.
          We use ‘should’ to talk about something that would be beneficial or better to do.
          “You should brush your teeth 3 times a day”.
          “You shouldn’t lie”.
          
          - Must / Mustn’t 
          
          Must is a rule.
          It is a rule that is possible to break.
          “You must be quiet during class”.
          “You mustn’t eat in class”.
          
          Have to / Don’t have to
          
          ‘Have to’ is a rule but ‘don’t have to’ means that something is not necessary.
          You have to be 21 to drink alcohol in the USA, but you don’t have to be 21 to drive!
          
          - Need / Needn’t
          
          ‘Need’ can be used to explain a rule.
          ‘Needn’t’ means that something is not necessary.
          “You need to finish high school before going to University”.
          “You needn’t tell me… I already know!”
          
          - Fun fact:
          
          Americans don’t use ‘must’ and ‘mustn’t’.
          They usually use ‘have to’ or ‘need to’ instead of using ‘must’.
          They usually use ‘can’t’ instead of ‘mustn’t’.
