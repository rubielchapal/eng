    <br>1.	Noun: is a word that functions as the name of a speciﬁc object or set of objects,  such as  living  creatures,  places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas. For example: Jhon, Paris, dog, book.

    <br>3.	An adverb is a word that modiﬁes (describes) a verb (he sings loudly), an adjective (very tall), another adverb (ended too quickly), or even a whole sentence  (Fortunately,  I  had  brought  an  umbrella).  Adverbs  typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc. For example: Loudly, very, too, just.

    <br><br>
    We have lived in London for 10 years.<br><br>
    ● Are we living in London right now?<br>
    ● When did we move to London?<br><br>

    have/has + past participle<br><br>

    Been to vs. gone to<br><br>

    Completed visits : <br>
    They have been to Paris.<br><br>

    Not returned yet:<br>
    They have gone to Paris.<br><br>

    ●	You can use “been” to describe completed visits. <br>
    ●	You can use “gone” to describe that you went to a place and you haven’t returned.<br><br>

    For example: <br>
    He's been to Australia three times. <br>
    She's gone to Paris. She will be back next week.<br><br>

    Have you ever _been_ to London?<br><br>

    2.  I have recently injured my hand.<br>
    3.  It’s been  raining for three days.<br>
    4.  I’ve been  having nightmares lately.<br><br>

    Recently and Lately <br><br>

    Recently is usually defined as 'not long ago'. <br>
    Lately is usually defined as 'recently or in the recent past'.<br><br>

    In the end, you can use them interchangeably in most of the cases.<br><br>

    Lately is also used to describe a repetitive event of the past. For example: <br>
    I have been studying a lot lately.<br><br>

    Recently, on the other hand, is used to show the occurrence of something in the near past, but it isn’t necessarily something repetitive. For example: I went to the gym recently.
    <br><br>
    Let’s practice.<br>
    Select the correct option. Both options might be possible.<br><br>

    ●	I went to the gym recently / lately.<br>
    ●	She’s been working out recently / lately.<br>
    ●	They have not been practicing English recently / lately.<br>
    ●	Mary has not been feeling well recently / lately.<br>
    ●	I recently / lately hurt my ankle.<br><br>
